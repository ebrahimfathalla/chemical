# Chemical in Cosmetics in the state of California  

● Description: In this project, we’re exploring data from the California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP), a public health initiative that tracks potentially harmful ingredients in cosmetic products sold in California. The dataset includes reports from different brands about substances that could pose health risks.
 Our goal is to determine which types of harmful ingredients appear most frequently and in which product categories they’re found in as well as which brands report them most often.
 This isn’t just a data exercise, we are also interested in what the results might mean for everyday consumers. Since cosmetics are used regularly by so many people so understanding what’s in them is important for health and safety, we hope our findings help make that a little clearer.
● Dataset: We used publicly available data from the California Safe Cosmetics Program. This dataset includes reports from various brands listing chemical ingredients that may pose health risks.
