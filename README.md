# Chemical in Cosmetics in the state of California  

# Project Overview

This project analyzes data from the California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP), a public health initiative that monitors potentially harmful ingredients in cosmetic products sold in California.

The dataset includes reports submitted by various brands identifying substances that may pose health risks. The main objectives of this analysis are:
	•	To identify the most frequently reported harmful ingredients
	•	To determine which categories of cosmetic products contain these substances
	•	To highlight the brands that report them most often

Beyond the technical analysis, we are also interested in the implications of these findings for consumers. Given how widely cosmetic products are used, understanding what goes into them is essential for public awareness and health.

# Dataset

The [data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SZFPh-YpraoJRAKcIfPUYmNTL450e8Y2) used in this project comes from the publicly available California Safe Cosmetics Program. It contains reports from manufacturers and brands listing chemical ingredients that have been linked to potential health risks.

# Analysis

Our analysis focused on the following key areas:
	•	Identifying the most commonly reported harmful chemicals
	•	Categorizing the types of products in which these chemicals appear
	•	Highlighting the brands that most frequently report these ingredients

These findings help illustrate broader trends in cosmetic ingredient use and may be valuable for researchers, regulators, and consumers alike.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, our analysis shows that a few harmful chemicals are often found in many cosmetic products. These chemicals are mostly found in certain types of products and are used by some brands more than others. This pattern might be important for safety rules in the future. Overall, our findings help people better understand what’s in their cosmetics and make smarter choices when buying them.
